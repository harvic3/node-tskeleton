## File Naming Conventions

When contributing to the project, please adhere to the following guidelines for naming files:

- **Index files** should be named in lowercase. For example, use `index.ts` instead of `Index.ts`.
- **Local resources** related to internationalization must start with a lowercase letter. For example, use `en.local.ts` for English language resources.
- **Class and Interface files** should start with an uppercase letter. For example, use `User.ts` for a class file and `IUser.ts` for an interface file.
- **Test files** should start with an uppercase letter. For example, use `User.ts` for a class file and `User.test.ts` for an interface file.
- **Especial files** should be according to the tool convention, for example `Dockerfile` for Docker or `.something` for some special tool.

Following these conventions helps maintain consistency and readability in the project's codebase. Thank you for contributing!
